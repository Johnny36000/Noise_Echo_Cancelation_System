# Noise_Echo_Cancelation_System

This project explores how echoes are made and how we can get rid of them. We start by explaining what echoes are and why they matter in different situations. Then, we show how we solve problems step by step. First, in the Simple Echo Model, we break down the process into three parts. We create echoes using math equations and also by mixing the original sound with delayed and quieter versions of itself. Then, we explore another method called convolution, which involves mixing the sound with a special pattern called an impulse response. Finally, we figured out how to remove the echoes we made. Next, we move on to the Infinite Echo Model, where we do something similar but on a larger scale. We can't actually create an infinite number of echoes, but we aim to make enough so it feels like there are many echoes. We use similar methods as before but adjust some settings to make it work. Throughout the study, we use graphs and charts to help explain what's happening. By showing both the theory and practical steps, we hope to make understanding echoes and how to deal with them easier for everyone.
